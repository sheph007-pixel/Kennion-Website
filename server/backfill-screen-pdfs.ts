/**
 * One-time, self-limiting backfill for stored Risk Screen PDFs.
 *
 * When the PDF renderer changes (PDF_RENDER_VERSION bumps), already-stored
 * PDFs in risk_screens are stale — they were rendered by the old code and
 * sit frozen in the DB as base64. The score data in resultJson is unchanged,
 * so we can simply re-render each PDF from its stored result and overwrite
 * pdfBase64. Each row is stamped with the render version it was last built
 * at (resultJson._pdfRenderVersion); rows already at the current version are
 * skipped, so this is idempotent and costs nothing on subsequent boots.
 *
 * Runs at startup (server/index.ts), after migrations + seed. Non-fatal: any
 * failure is logged and the server continues to boot.

// from, how the demographics compare to industry benchmarks, and the
// share of lives sitting in each tier band. Was previously an LLM call;
// gpt-4o-mini produced direction-reversed text ("higher older-band
// scores contribute positively to the overall score") because the
// prompt did not state the directionality. A template avoids that
// class of bug entirely and reads more like an underwriter's note
// than a generic confirmation.

// Benchmarks match the long-form `generateActuarialAnalysis` prompt

Company: ${input.companyName}
Risk Tier: ${input.riskTier}
Risk Score: ${input.riskScore} (1.0 = average, <1.0 = better than average, >1.0 = worse than average)

Group Composition:
- ${input.totalLives} total covered lives

- ${input.spouseCount || 0} spouses
- ${input.childrenCount || 0} children
- Average age: ${input.averageAge} years
- Employee average age: ${input.characteristics.averageEmployeeAge} years
- Gender mix: ${femalePercentage}% female
- Average family size: ${avgFamilySize}
- Dependency ratio: ${dependencyRatio}

Industry Benchmarks for Comparison:

- Average family size: 1.91
- Female percentage: 50.96%

Risk Factors Identified:

Instructions:
1. Write in plain English at an 8th grade reading level - clear and easy to understand
2. DO NOT include any personally identifiable information (PHI) - only use aggregate statistics
3. NEVER use em dashes (—) - use hyphens (-) or rewrite sentences instead
4. Explain what makes this group's risk profile ${input.riskTier}
5. Compare their demographics to industry benchmarks and explain what that means for pricing
6. Discuss age distribution impact on expected healthcare utilization
7. Explain how the MARA (Multi-factor Actuarial Risk Analysis) model evaluated this group
8. Mention key actuarial factors like:
   - Expected medical cost trends for this age/gender mix
   - How family size impacts premiums
   - The significance of their dependency ratio
   - Why their risk score of ${input.riskScore} matters
9. If Preferred or Standard risk: Explain why they qualify for the Kennion program and potential savings
10. If High risk: Explain why fully-insured may be better and what factors drove the higher risk score
11. Keep it professional but conversational - like an expert advisor explaining to a business owner
12. Focus on what this means for THEM - not generic insurance information
13. Length: 3-4 paragraphs, roughly 250-350 words total

Write ONLY the analysis text. No preamble, no "Here's the analysis" - just start with the analysis itself.`;
